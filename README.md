# Logistical-Regression-Machine-Learning
Includes Gradient Descent, Error Cost, Sigmoid, Boundary Values, Loss etc.

Comparing Classification ML to Log Regression w/ Error, Cost Function &amp; Sigmoid Function
Use the correspoding python files with the ipynb files to call custom functions
run classification first to get an idea of linear regression model limits

the .py files are supplementary to the ipynb files, just change the ipynb to .py to run on your 
IDE, these were created in Juypter for convenience initially
